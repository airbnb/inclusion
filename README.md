# inclusion

Welcome to the public home for the ongoing efforts at Airbnb to build an engineering culture where all engineers feel like they can belong.

## Infractions

We are publicly sharing `infractions.yml`. `infractions.yml` is a data file of terms that we consider legacy in Airbnb code and systems. These terms are considered legacy since they do not promote belonging and inclusion.

The data file format is agnostic to any particular tool and is meant to be general enough to be adapted to any tool.
