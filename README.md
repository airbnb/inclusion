# inclusion

Welcome to the public home for the ongoing efforts at Airbnb to build an engineering culture where all engineers feel like they can belong. 

We are publicly sharing `infraction.yml`. `infractions.yml` is a data file of terms that we consider legacy in Airbnb code and systems. These terms are considered legacy since they do not promote belonging and inclusion.
